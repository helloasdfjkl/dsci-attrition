					<h3>why this dataset is important</h3>
					<p>The dataset I used for this project is called “Employee Attrition and Factors,” which I found
						on Kaggle. Thinking about how I will be entering the industry workforce when I graduate (in
						almost exactly one year now!), this dataset is relevant to my future as well as anyone else
						who has the same goal, and my hope is that analyzing this data will reveal patterns to
						reasons why people unexpectedly leave their jobs.

						<h3>pre-analysis predictions!</h3>
						<p>Out of the variables offered in the dataset, some I find notable are distance from home,
							number of years in this role, and salary.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>distance from home</b>: as COVID shifted peoples’ perspectives on how important being
								in the
								office is, I suspect that many people wouldn’t be too happy with living too far from
								their workplace</li>
							<li><b>number of years in this role</b>: I haven’t looked too deeply into the job roles and
								job
								levels offered, but I would expect that those who are in a role for a long time without
								promotion might get bored/search for other opportunities. But, maybe they just really
								like that role?
							</li>
							<li><b>salary</b>: I’ve personally witnessed my parents job hunting throughout the years,
								and it’s
								always been with a primary motivation of earning more money. Naturally, jobs are meant
								to make money, and not being content with salary can lead people to search elsewhere.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These results can help me decide what some significant variables are when considering if a
							company retains a lot of employees...</p>

						<h2 class="major">peeking at our data</h2>
						<p>Firstly, I wanted to see what kind of dataset I would be working with. Below are some graphs
							(pie chart and histograms)
							to visualize the distribution of data points in our dataset. I separated people by 1.
							whether they left the company or
							not (attrition/left = yes, no attrition/stayed = no), age, education level, job department,
							job level, and years at their
							company.

						<h2 class="major">are there any correlations between variables?</h2>
						<image width="500px" src="images/corr.png" />
						<p>
							Some of the variables that have a correlation to each other are 
							age, department, job level, job role, marital status, numcompaniesworked, performance
							rating, total working years, years at company, years in current role, years since last
							promotion, years with current manager.
							<br /><br />
							The variables that involve years having correlation makes sense bc years naturally increase, so all the years would be correlated to each other.
							Another point that I noticed was that it looks like gender doesn't matter too much, which is contrary to what I thought... I wanted to see if gender
							had any part in the reason why employees left. Maybe there just weren't enough data points?

						<h2 class="major">does years worked = loyalty?</h2>
						<p style="float: left">I separated female and male and analyzed the effect of the number of years one was in their current role, seeing if gender had any effect on income. 
							I also separated this by whether or not the employee eventually left the company. The results were actually contrary to what I thought, that employees who left would 
						have a lower income. Rather, Attrition=1 (employees stayed), had a lower monthly income. However, this might also be attributed to the fact that the x axis is the number 
					of years that an employee spent in a specific role. This doesn't include job promotions, or any role shifts.</p>

						</div>
						<p style="float: right">Next, let's look at some substantive effects plots to closer analyze which variables have an effect on whether or not employees left the company or not.
						Most of these results make sense. For example, those in a higher job level tended to leave the company less. Employees who were farther away from the office tended to leave the 
					company more than those who had a closer job. etc, etc.</p>

					<p>Finally, interact with this graph! It's been split up into job level so you can clearly see employees' job satisfaction. Light blue dots represent employees who left, and dark blue
						dots represent employees who stayed. This line graph/scatterplot compares an employee's years spent total at a company with their overall job satisfaction. From the results, it looks like 
						there wasn't really a linear trend, and all job levels had around the same job satisfaction. The only difference was that there were less data points in the lower job levels.
